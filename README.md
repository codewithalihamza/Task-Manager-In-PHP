# ToDo-In-PHP
This is my Freelance Project

1. Create a server-side script using PHP:
a. Set up a PHP file, such as “tasks.php”, to handle server-side operations.
b. Implement the necessary endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, 
Delete) to interact with the task data.
c. Connect to a database (e.g., MySQL) and perform database operations to store 
and retrieve task data.
d. Implement user authentication using PHP and sessions to secure access to the 
application's functionality.
e. Associate tasks with specific users and ensure that each user can only view, edit, 
and delete their own tasks.

2. Modify the JavaScript code to interact with the server-side script:
a. Update the JavaScript functions to make AJAX requests to the PHP endpoints for 
CRUD operations instead of manipulating tasks directly in memory.
b. Use the Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to send HTTP requests to the PHP 
endpoints and handle the responses.
c. Parse the JSON responses received from the server and update the task list 
accordingly.

3. Enhance the user interface and add more features:
a. Improve the styling and visual appeal of the task manager using CSS.
b. Implement additional features such as task prioritization, task categories, and 
task deadlines.
c. Enable users to set reminders for tasks and receive notifications.
d. Implement additional sorting and filtering options, such as sorting by priority or 
filtering by category.
e. Add the ability for users to upload attachments or files related to tasks.
f. Implement search functionality to allow users to search for specific tasks based on 
keywords or criteria
